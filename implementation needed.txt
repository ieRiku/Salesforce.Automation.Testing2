1. Use try - catch block in test cases for error handling (only in certain places as if applied to tests all tests pass without the hard assertions)(done-partially)

2. Use Iretry analyser for failed test cases such as (filterApply)
3. Fill the execelUtils code even though its not used
4. Implement headless mode (especially for the ci/cd pipeline)
5. Implement a new class called SmokeRunner.java which runs the smoke cases and also should have a driver.quit() method so that browser closes.
6. Implement assertion if possible at least in login module. (done)
